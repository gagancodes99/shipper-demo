/**
 * ORIGINAL APP.JS - PRESERVED FOR REFERENCE
 * 
 * This file contains the original monolithic App component that has been refactored
 * into the new modular structure with:
 * 
 * - Context providers (AuthContext, JobsContext, TransactionContext)
 * - Routing system (AppRouter)
 * - Separate screen components
 * - BookingFlow component for the 8-step booking process
 * 
 * The original functionality has been preserved and enhanced with:
 * - User authentication and profile management
 * - Job lifecycle management
 * - Transaction and payment processing
 * - Responsive navigation with bottom tabs
 * 
 * New architecture:
 * index.js → Context Providers → AppRouter → Screen Components
 * 
 * This file is kept for reference and rollback purposes.

// - src/components/AppRouter.js (main routing)
// - src/components/BookingFlow.js (8-step booking process)
// - src/components/screens/ (individual screen components)
// - src/context/ (state management contexts)
